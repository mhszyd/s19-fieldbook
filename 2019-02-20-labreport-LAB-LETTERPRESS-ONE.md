For this lab, I managed to compose the heading and about half of the first line of text. I found it oddly soothing to do and watch the lines of test build up and know that I was the one creating that, even if I wasn't very fast or efficient. It was an interesting way to connect with the readings. Ben Franklin did close to the exact same thing I was doing and that made me realize the skill involved in print culture. I always knew it involved a lot of skill, especially to do as much as they did as quickly as they did, but it was jarring to actually do some of it for myself. It is interesting to me actually how much Ben Franklin devalued the act of composing off the cuff. It seems hard to me! I certainly would not have been able to do a decent job without writing down what I wanted to say, so if Keimer could then he is a lot more impressive than I. On the other hand, I can see how it would quickly become more nonsensical than those who wrote down what they planned to print first.

I can see how it would have been a serious undertaking to print a book! It felt like a serious and dirty undertaking just to print that little poem. As much as we as a culture today value the book above all other forms of writing and printing, it makes perfect sense that in the age of the manual printer, printing shops were more interested in other forms of printing. They undoubtably made more money printing pamphlets, broadsides, and institutional paperwork like indulgences, currency, or deeds than by making books. It may have been easier than when the monks handwrote books, but it still was not as easy as it is today. Not to mention, western society needs stories but arguably not books, not the same way it needs the institutional paperwork to function smoothly. Therefore, given that it is expensive and less essential, commiting to publishing an entire, lengthy book doesn't make economic sense and as much as the entire structure of the world is not formed exclusively by ecomonomic factors, its not always worth it to publish a book that you're not sure will do will if the author is not like Margaret Cavendish, who had the funding to allow her to publish whether anyone read it or not. It was an interesting way to think about the older books I have too, since I have a (very) few that would have been printed before real modern cheap printing. I already was very proud that my grandmother had entrusted them to me, but now I am aware of what went into creating them.
