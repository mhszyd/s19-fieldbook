This lab reminded me a great deal of learning how to use do topic modeling, which I did for my project last semester in Cameron's class, which I found fascinating. The ability to count words is really only useful in specific instances, but it can be very helpful when looking for patterns in a massive corpus, which is what I did with the letters from the Jane Addams Papers Project for my project. I see the value, certainly, in being able to write the code for these kinds of things myself, or at least recognize what's going on. 

The actual process of how it works was a little confusing to me, mostly thanks to a vicious headache that did not go away until late the next day, but I did find it easy enough to follow to understand what was happening. Knowing how to pull from outside sources without having to upload it yourself makes sense, given the size of the corpus we were dealing with. I certainly don't have the complete works of Jane Austen anywhere on my computer, or the room to store it even if I wanted to. Being able pull that from some other archive or online storage is useful, and gives me the ability to access a lot more information than I realized I could without having to meticulously keep track of it myself. A true ode to digital resource sharing!
