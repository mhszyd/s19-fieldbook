The readings for Book Week continued the conversation about format from last week, asking questions about what qualifies as a book and how they are created and distributed. Again, there are challenges to the modern Western thought of what it means to be a book and calls to "decolonize" the current scholarly concept of a book, which particularly focuses on American Indian forms of writing and recording information as legitimate. Does the format of the book require it to be written down using an alphabet on something western scholars recognize as paper and bound with a cover? Is the object what makes it a book? In that case, the  “Baxter’s Procustes” in the reading by Chesnutt would be a book, regardless of the fact that it has nothing written inside it except the title, while an ebook or even a cuneiform tablet would not qualify as a book despite containing valuable information. 

Drucker is a particularly strong advocate of changing this understanding of what a book is. She argues that it is limited and racist, and I am inclined to agree with her. A book is more than an object, and more than a story or record as well. Its form changes depending on the civilization, and the object aspect of the book is important, as well as the industries around it, arguably more important than the actual content in understanding what a book is. A story is separate from a book, which is an important point that is emphasized by author after author. The physicality of the book itself sets it apart from oral history or memory and enables historians to study how the book even came to be.

Therefore, understanding the publishing industry is essential to understanding books themselves in Western society. It explains why books were formatted a particular way and how economics played into the creation of texts. That understanding should be extended to other societies as well, to focus on how the object of the book gets created. Current focuses on the textual content misses lots of other factors that mark books. Who owns them? Who makes them? What are they made of? Who writes them? How do people get them? All these factors influence a book's creation and can help in demystifying and decolonizing books for book historians, who can then create a much better, bigger picture around books for a fuller understanding of the context.
