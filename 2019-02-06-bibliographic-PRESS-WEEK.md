During important points in modern history, a free and independent press has been essential for the spread of ideas and knowledge, occasionally in books but more often in other forms, like newspapers and pamphlets. The American Revolution in particular was a war fought in the newspapers just as much as it was a physical war fought on the battlefield. Though we did not read that part of his autobiography, Ben Franklin's knowledge of printing was instrumental in the buildup to war, sharing news across the colonies and uniting vastly different places under the same set of ideas and goals. Printing, in a society where literacy was surprisingly rampant, made all the difference, just as it did almost a century later during the abolition movement. As Dinius examines in "The Press", the parallel between how patriots and loyalists treated the press and abolitionists and anti-abolitionists treated the press is clear, because in silencing the physical press, because "if he had no way to print his objectionable political views, he would be silenced" (749). The importance of the press to these groups trying to get out their arguments and control dissent is clear. 

The ability of people in power to present their ideas using the printing press dramatically altered the course of human history simply by altering the way information was dissiminated. Though Borsuk looks specifically at books, the uniformity and new cheapness of paper extends beyond just to the novels and treatsies people read to the pamphlets and newspapers that were now cheaper and easier to print in mass quantities. The human element that was so clear in early books and manuscripts seems to fade the closer to modern times we get. Even newspapers as a genre cannot exist without the change in materiality that allows the the quick production of mass quantities of printed paper, jumpstarted by Gutenburg and improved on as time marched on. As Gittleman makes clear, codexes were not the only thing, or even the most important thing, that was printed and reframing discussion of the press and printing in general around all types of printing, not just books, reframes our understanding of the world at that time.
