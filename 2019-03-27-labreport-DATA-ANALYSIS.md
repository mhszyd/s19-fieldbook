For this week, we looked at newspapers and the different ways we could manipulate the data. By manipulate, of course, I don't mean that we use the data to lie, but simply that we work with the data to highlight different pieces of it. Data does not exist in a vaccuum, and the data we use (in this case, a list of newspapers titles with their state, city (where known), and start and end dates) is highly dependent on what we think is worthy of collecting. Klein and D’Ignazio are very clear about that, and I would go further and say that even the data that *is* collected isn't always collected in a way that is helpful to a specific project. We used coding to put the start and end dates in decades, which let us look at the data at a less precise glance, looking for things like change over time in the types of names and spikes in newspaper creation, as well answer location questions like what states had higher numbers of newspapers. We did not do coding that would look at the length of time that newspapers existed, though I'm sure that's possible and I would have been interested to see it. The NY Post is one of the oldest newspapers in the country, for example, and I would love to see if it went through different iterations and compare the length it existed against other New York papers, or other papers from the original 13 states, for example. But that data was missing from the table we were working in, and it makes me wonder if that data exists anywhere other than the NY Post's archives. 

Many of my questions- as well as, I suspect, Klein and D’Ignazio's- are ultimately rooted in what is publicly available. Questions of what gets digitized, when digitized what gets posted on the web? What gets kept in the first place? What is studied? What is recorded? Good digital historians, and really anyone in the digital humanities, constantly ask these kinds of questions. Not least because questioning the data can yield as much information as the data itself. A lack of information is, in and of itself, information. If I can't find maternal death rates, what does that tell me about how society thinks about maternal deaths, especially black ones? If I look at the historical census and I see slaves valued at 3/5 of a white man, including a white indentured servant, for the purposes of population, what does that tell me about the value of a black person? If the census doesn't even define anyone as an American Indian, or some version thereof, that doesn't mean they didn't exist but that they were not counted or valued. The newspaper records we looked at noted the cities they came from, the states, the start and end dates. The records did not note who published them, whether they were connected to bigger companies, as the *Indianapolis Star* is a subsidiary of *USA Today*, which in turn is owned by Gannett Co. That would be interesting information to look at! Who owns the news we look at? The question of data isn't one that looks just what is contained in the data itself, it also asks what *isn't*.
