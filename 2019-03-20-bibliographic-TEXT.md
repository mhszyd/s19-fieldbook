I think we all know intellectually that digital files and paper files are fundamentally different. The way we process them is different, something my mother enjoys reminding me as often as possible when I tell her about the work I do here. We may use same terminology, talking about things like files and folders, pages and type, but they are completely different things on their base level. There's complicated underlying layers to the digital elements that simply do not exist in the paper ones, things like ownership and copyright and increasingly questions of security. I personally have just accepted that my phone is listening to everything I say and nothing I ever do will be private ever again but since actually overthrowing and executing the bourgeoise capitalists in charge doesn't seem like an activity that my largely risk averse self is up for, I imagine it'll remain that way for a little while at least. The amount of control other people can have over the digital world is a legitimate source of concern for me and Dennis Tenen. I am not the master of the means of my own production, and even if I were it is still not the same thing as if I were using a quill pen and parchment, or cave drawings to communicate. The medium is still the message, as we learned all the way back in the beginning of the semester and that continues to be true as computers and phones reshape the way we operate in the world. This can be a bad thing, in the sense that the many layers alter the way we communicate, but it can also be a good thing. Progress is a good thing, and media has been changing since we first started using it. Language changes, paper changes, forms of communication change and all this is perfectly normal. The essay I wrote to get into grad school is quite different than the writing of Mercy Otis Warren even though they were both historical essays. We need to be aware of the difference in how we interact when we use computers, but it is not destroying the foundation of democracy or civilization. How I interact when I text someone vs. if I wrote them a letter vs. speaking to them over the phone vs. speaking to them in person are salient, but not a bad thing. In fact, we should embrace the changes! 

Though I certainly (provisionally) support the dramatic changes to our communication that is happening right now, I am still deeply comforted by how much the same we remain. Words are fake to begin with, and have no inherent meaning. So when we change the meanings of words, whether through the passage of time or through changing technologies, it makes sense that we might also add in new types of symbolic communications. Emoticons are a particularly excellent example of this process. We lack body language over text communications the way we would have them in in person ones, something addressed at the turn of the 20th century as surely as it is today. Creating standard facial expressions, in newspaper emoticons, then in text emoticons, now arguably in emojis that have extremely specific names and meanings (I will send heart eyes emojis to my good friends and loving family, but I really would never send one to you under any circumstance, for example) and an unspoken social etiquette. The message encoded in these expressions of characters is far more complex than we think about when we write them. I have a reasonable expectation that if I type out :-) or :) that the person on the other end will "read" it as an expression of happiness or :P as a expression of joking or annoyance. These things, the attempts to convey tonal and visual messages through strictly linguistic means is not easy, but we as humans continue to strive for them. I attach gifs to my tweets sometimes when I want to make the tone of my message clear, I send emojis, and I try my best to make sure I am not misinterpreted over text. But still there are hidden messages in my texts that only those I am closest to understand. I'll make specific references and my best friend understands *immediately* that I am not okay. Or I'll overuse a specific emoji and she'll ask me why I'm so happy, like Scott Weingart recognizes his wife's I love you means more than what it says on the surface. There's layers of meaning to every form of communication we have ever used, why would text of any kind be any different? Media is merely that particular form of a message. Humans are still humans at their core, no matter how differently they may understand and interact with Shakespeare when its online instead of in an illustrated physical book.
