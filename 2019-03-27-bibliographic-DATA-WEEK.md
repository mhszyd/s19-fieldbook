This week was interesting because it described the way the human element is involved in the creation and sythesis of data. Klein and D’Ignazio, who I had to read for Cameron too, attack the way we societally view white (presumably cis, straight) men as normative and everyone who does not fit that definition, which is of course most of the world, as more of an aberration. Even if we accept the cultural premise that algorithms always work as intended, that totally erases the fact that they were *created* by a human. And these humans have biases and hangups and a million other reasons why the idea of neutrality is a myth. Therefore, what Klein and D’Ignazio say about data science and analysis needing a new framework for looking at data, and in creating as well, is desperately important and relevant, especially in light of the way coorporations are continually using our data to sell us things and people are dying because they aren't "valuable" enough. What stage of capitalism are we in again? When companies are driving information gathering and using it for their own gain, rather than to make the world a better place? When mortality rates of women, especially fat women, is ridiculously high *because they aren't listened to by doctors*. And yet we do not actually really track that information, it's simply known to women because they've experienced it or seen someone they know experience it. That's crappy data collection and instead the concerns of women are brushed off, especially when it comes to reproductive health. I'll get off my soapbox now and just say that I see evidence of Klein and D’Ignazio's points in my own life. 

People are intimately involved in data in ways we often do not think about. From the *type* of data collected to the *way* data is collected to the way the data is *displayed*, every piece of data usage is human driven. Even the creation of ways to process data is human driven, as Charles Babbage and Lady Lovelace, display. What drove them to design the Difference and Analytical Engines the way they did? Would it have looked different if Ada had not been badly abused as a child and instead been given a more well-rounded education? Would the Analytical Engine have been completed if Charles Babbage had been a little less absent-minded or been able to secure funding?  *The Thrilling Adventures of Babbage and Lovelace* was a really interesting reminder of how different things could have turned out if small details of their lives had been different. It was another perspective on the way that people impact data on a deep level.
