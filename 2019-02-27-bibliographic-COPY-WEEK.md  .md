The focus of this week is on how the medium affects the content from the perspective of digitalization. We as a society have not yet wrapped our head around the fact that exclusively digital elements are completely different from printed or physical ones. How they are created, viewed, and understood is not the same, however much we may think it is. And they shouldn't be! This harkens back to the very first week, and how the medium impacts the message, even is the message at times. When I write online, I don't make things look pretty the same way I might if its in pront. Online, no one can tell that my handwriting is terrible and I cannot draw, whereas when things are printed and physical they tend to have significantly more focus. Even the way I type in this markdown file is dramatically different than I would write on paper. Recognizing that, and recognizing that search functions, despite the issues with OCR, are deeply a part of how we experience these online and digitized spaces. An online archive that you can't search will never get used. But items in digital spaces are interpreted and reinterpreted by the curators and that is relevant information. How it's framed and how it's used by creators and users is a really important question that we are still struggling to answer. Therefore, it seems necessary to view online pieces not as devoid of medium or meaning, like they sprung out of Zeus' head, but as part and parcel to the stories they tell.

Public history is all about context, and digital humanities is the same. Bibliographies and sources are part of that context. When I worked for the JAne Addams Papers Project, context was the most important thing we did. It was a challenging situation sometimes, since the actual letters could be transcribed by hand, but the creation of context relied on newspapers and other records, which came from a wide variety of places. So we had to be careful what we used. We could use Wikipedia but it had to be checked against other sources. We could use newspapers to identify death dates, causes of death, and conduct in life, but we had to check to make sure it was the right person in the entry. OCR was frequently, frustratingly wrong. Digital tools *are* extraordinary and wonderful, but they are still bounded by the medium they are in. To fail to recognize that, is to fail to recognize what the internet is and what it can be. It is a tool with rules and the ability to be good or bad, like any other medium or form of content communication. But we have not designed the rules very well yet, so it is largely a medium without a clear path for use, which is something I think today's reading addressed,even if they failed to provide real, solid, permanent solutions. But the suggestions they made point the way to such a solution, if we choose to follow it.
