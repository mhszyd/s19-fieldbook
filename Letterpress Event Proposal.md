Event Title: Public History & Historical Tools

Institution: Northeastern University

Event Organizer: Meg Szydlik

###Project Summary

This event would be an hour and a half long introduction to the letterpress printing press, organized by Meg Szydlik in conjunction with and run by Ryan Cordell and his team. Though the event would technically be open to the entire school, it would be aimed at the History department, specifically the public history MA students, as a way to connect the department to a useful historical tool present on the campus. There would be pre-determined and prepared type ready for participants to use after learning about the history of the letterpress and how to operate it. The event will (hopefully) be sponsored by the History department, or possibly a first semester student's class, such as Marty Blatt's Introduction to Public History class.

##Intellectual Rationale

History students, particularly public history students, are engaged in work that directly involves historical objects. One really important way to make someone a better historian is to have them use the objects they study. The materiality of history is something that public history is highly focused on, so attending a workshop with the letterpress an excellent way for public history students to get hands on experience that will help them be better public historians, and any other history students that attend just better historians. The primary goal of this event is to connect students with the active materiality of using the press and get them to think about how to connect that to their own work in public history, with its material culture focus.

Understanding the process of how history happened materially can help make historical connections. There are many stories of tradespeople figuring out things that have baffled historians who did not think about the activity the same way as someone actually doing it does. One very well known one is the hairdresser who figured out that some ancient Roman styles required the hair to be sewn, not pinned, in place, something that had confounded historians for a long time because they focused on the translation that made the most sense to people who did not attend cosmetology school (Stephens). While using a letterpress is hardly the lost art that ancient Roman hairdressing is, it is still an important window into how understanding a trade qualifies a historian to understand a time period better. 

For the primary audience of public historians, that is especially important, since knowing the basics of how to operate these kinds of machines is useful. A lot of popular history places, like Faneuil Hall here in Boston and the Benjamin Franklin Printing House in Philadelphia, have active printing presses. Talking about public history is also very different than actively doing it, and so having that experience will be valuable to them. While there is a fieldwork requirement for all public history students,  As this is slated for the beginning of the school year, it will also be a good way to introduce the new students to both the resources available at the school, and the field of public history itself in a very real and direct way. Ultimately, the main objective of this event is to connect public historians to a living piece of public history and get them to think about the materiality of that history in a way that is not really covered in classes.

##Content, Design, and Implementation

The workshop will be run by Ryan Cordell and his team. Therefore, the exact structure will be up to him. He will discuss with the students some of the history of the letterpress and of the history of books and printing in general. He will also explicitly link the exercise they will do in printing the preset type, with the work the students do in their own field, both when they actively use things like printing presses, and when they engage with the products, as in archives. His training in book history and the materiality of books allows him to discuss more fully what impact the material culture of printing had on less obvious elements, like interface, form, and even content with students who are specifically being trained to care about such things. A well developed workshop would include ample opportunity for discussion and some on the spot analysis of what our understanding of what a book is and how that has been shaped by printing and material culture, both more formally guided by Ryan Cordell and through more casual conversations among the students themselves. Additionally, some discussion of job printing and the focus of printing on broadsides and money printing, rather than books, in order to make money will be valuable for the students.

Ryan Cordell and his team will then take the pre-set type and show the students how to use the letterpress to print copies for themselves. Because the primary expected audience will be public history students, the text will be from the National Council on Public History's Code of Ethics. It is displayed below:

#####The Public Historiansâ€™ Responsibility to the Public
1. Public historians should serve as advocates for the preservation, care, and accessibility of historical records and resources of all kinds, including intangible cultural resources.

2. Public historians should carry out historical research and present historical evidence with integrity.

3. Public historians should strive to be culturally inclusive in the practice of history and in the presentation of history.

4. Public historians should be fully cognizant of the purpose or purposes for which their work is intended, recognizing that research-based decisions and actions may have long-term consequences.

5. Public historians should maintain a conscious regard for the interpersonal dynamics inherent in historical practice.

This code of ethics, which is central to the good practice of public history, can then be used by the students as a reminder of their obligations as the keepers of the historical treasures and museums. Using a form of public history to create a copy of the ethics would be a good way to drive home the importance of the work of public historians, especially to new students in the field.

##Institutional Context

This event will take place at Northeastern University in Boston. It will be in CSSH's graduate studies as an interdisciplinary effort between Meg Szydlik, the event organizer, from the History department and Ryan Cordell, who manages the letterpress, of the English department. 

##Evaluation

This event will primarily be evaluated through verbal feedback to the organizer, Meg Szydlik, which will be collected through casual conversations with attendees.
