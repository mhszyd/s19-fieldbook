Working by candlelight was definitely an odd experience that made me appreciate the electric light and computers I used to produce transcriptions. Though I personally have no trouble reading script, even fairly complicated script, thanks to my job at the Jane Addams Papers Project, the transcription process was still challenging for other reasons. The biggest struggle I personally had was that my fingers started cramping and my back was in pain by the time we finished. It was also very frustrating because the light wasn't steady, making reading the words I was meant to transcribe and the geography book significantly more difficult than it would have been using modern illumiation. However, on the flip side, it would have been impossible to do at all without the candlelight, making it a vital tool of the trade and one I was thankful for. Also the fact that it was a nice candle instead of a cheap one made a huge difference in how effective it was. It gave me new respect for anyone who read or wrote before modern times and made me so very thankful for my own modern technology.

I will be examining digital exhibits in the same way that I examined the effects of the candlelight and writing manually. Digital exhibits can appear on many different platforms, but the one I am most familiar with is Omeka. Omeka requires a coding scaffolding that I am not familiar with to run, though I do not need to know how to code in order to use it. However, more importantly, digital exhibits are digital. They require the "candlelight" of internet access in order to create and view them. When historians or librarians or students or even PBS create these exhibits, they universally make the assumption that most people have access to the internet. This is not necessarily true, though it is not neccessarily a major concern for the creators' to handle. However, it still does need to be acknowledged that, just as reading and writing in the time before electric lights required candlelight, creating and viewing a digital exhibit requires access to both a computer and the internet in order to function as we expect it to. The internet also offers limitations on what can be done, since the object would need to be photographed or scanned so it can be viewed, which can be difficult. However, using the internet also allows for so much more interesting ways to view a particular object or set of objects. Omeka allows for one object to be connected to lots of other objects, making it possible for someone to look at a specific topic or person. It also allows for a lot of different forms of media to be presented to the public, so they can explore information in whatever way works best for them, from embedded videos to text to images. This multimedia format is wildly different than physical exhibits, which tend to rely on objects and text to tell their story. Even physically exhibits will often have an online presence to promote accessibilty and make use of the many tools available online. In that way, the internet has fundamentally changed the way museums and exhibits function.
