The question of interface isn't just a question of what is the easiest way for the user to read, but according to Borsuk it is also a question of what makes the content engagable and helps us understand the book itself better. Whether that is a digital screen that we effectively see as invisible, or a set of cards (with a tell-all story that makes me very glad I'm not living this particular woman's life) in a box or a set of pictures of burning another book, for the writers we read for today, the interface is as important as the content. I remain unconvinced. Interface *is* important and living with someone who is getting her degree in publishing has been informative in that regard. But that does not mean you need to break the interface. It's not the patriarchy, we have a lot more to lose than our chains. I'm generally not a fan of things with the express goal of "breaking the paradigm" or of doing things for what is essentially shock value. Breaking the paradigm, whatever that may mean specifically, is fine, but shaking things up for the sake of shaking things up is inelegant and not especially useful. In most case, I've found, it means making your mark however you can and I object to that in the strongest of terms. Thinking about materiality is all very well and good, and necessary even, but when it is done in this way where people will instinctively reject it because it is too strange, too unusual, then it is not doing its job. Change is painful and incremental, and given that we're still using a map of the world that makes Greenland far bigger than it actually is and Africa far smaller, I think it's fine that we still grapple with a more traditional interface. Humans love order, and there's a difference between changing the codex so it's bound differently and completely altering public perception of what a book is. A handful of academics and artists pushing the limits of what a book is do not a shift in culture make, nor should they. 

Interface is bound by many things, the author, the publisher, companies, the medium, and more. But at its core, if an interface is not democratic, it has failed. That is to say, I see much of the democratization of publishing as a good thing! Why shouldn't I be able to write something and publish it without having to go through the extremely closed process of getting an agent and an editor and a publisher? Arguably, it's classist and elitist, and cuts off plenty of people who do not have the money or connections to go the traditional way. Of course, there are really strong arguments in favor of publishers having control, not least of which is that I'd like my roommate to be employed, including things like reach, as well as having people who can catch typos and ensure that the text is as strong as possible. And they have people on staff who understand interface. We can explore interface in new and different ways, and I think Jon Bois did a really good job of that in his story, but we can do it without breaking it. We can use the codex or not use the codex, but it shouldn't feel like some vague, new for the sake of new, decision without taking the time to consider why. Like the bird book that Mod talks about, or the Choose Your Own Adventure books, or *Between Page and Screen* that Ortega looks at, there are ways to have fun with interface, to make it work for that particular author and that particular story. You can construct a book entirely out of letters, memos, and notes (*Regarding the Fountain* will forever be a favorite of mine, the fact that it is for children entirely nonwithstanding), you can chose bright illustrations, no illustrations, or make a book comprised entirely of photographs with captions. All of that is using the interface to engage the reader with the book more directly. I agree that there are concerns about simply taking a codex and flattening it, as is so often done online and that publishers should take the online medium into account. 

At the same time, there are legitimate points to be made about accessibility, both in that the text is easier (and often cheaper) to access online to those without decent libraries and in the accessibility of the text for the disabled community, something I felt was appallingly lacking from conversations about interface. Do only the sighted get to experience books? Should we continue to ignore typeset that is easier for dyslexics to read? Are people who struggle with fine motor skills or mobility issues also to be cut off from texts? In all the posturing about the end of books and of the world as we know it that is frequently a common thread throughout the semester, did anyone consider communities outside of their own? I confess I saw little enough evidence of it outside of one conversation about audiobooks which was less about the people who could actually find them useful, and more of a point about multiple mediums existing together. Or do they all magically get healed- as they were in Bois' world, whether they would choose it or not? It is worth asking these questions when we're talking about interface and medium, since that is the source of this community's struggles. Interface can help or it can hurt, and the question of who gets access to what interfaces and mediums, and who the design questions are meant to benefit is a fairly important one and certainly not one that should be ignored.
